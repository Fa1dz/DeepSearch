## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

In `DeepSearchGUI.py` or CLI:

```python
# Search depth
max_results = 15   # 5-30 recommended

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ddgs not installed"
```bash
pip install ddgs
```

### Issue: "spacy model not found"
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Issue: "customtkinter import error"
```bash
pip install --upgrade customtkinter
```

### Issue: GUI won't open
```bash
# Check all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Issue: Slow search
- Reduce `max_fetch` parameter
- Increase `delay` to respect rate limits
- Use fewer `max_results`

---

## 🚀 Performance Tips

1. **Faster Searches**: Reduce `max_fetch` and `delay`
2. **Better Analysis**: Increase `max_fetch` and use smaller `delay`
3. **Batch Processing**: Use CLI for multiple queries
4. **Memory**: Works well on 4GB+ RAM machines
5. **Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
